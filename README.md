artemis-odb-contrib
===================

Drop-in extensions for artemis-odb. Prefab systems, components, networking, 
event bus! Well, eventually anyway.

### When to use this
If you want to quickly prototype a game without getting bogged down by the
details of implementing various systems in an entity component system, 
this package will help get you started.

I use this as my toolkit for jam games. You are welcome to use it for 
whatever you need! 

Alternatively, if you want to properly set up artemis-odb + libgdx or playn 
with gwt support, check out these instead:
- [libgdx-artemis-quickstart](https://github.com/DaanVanYperen/libgdx-artemis-quickstart)
- [playn-artemis-quickstart](https://github.com/DaanVanYperen/playn-artemis-quickstart)
