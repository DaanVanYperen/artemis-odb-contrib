artemis-odb-contrib
===================

Drop-in extensions for artemis-odb. Event bus, deferred systems, prefab
systems, components and networking. Well, eventually anyway.

### When to use this
If you want to quickly prototype a game without getting bogged down by the
details of entity component systems, this package will help get you started.

I use this as my toolkit for jam games. You are welcome to use it for whatever you need!

Alternatively, if you want to properly set up artemis-odb + libgdx or playn 
with gwt support, check out these instead:
- [libgdx-artemis-quickstart](https://github.com/DaanVanYperen/libgdx-artemis-quickstart)
- [playn-artemis-quickstart](https://github.com/DaanVanYperen/playn-artemis-quickstart)

### Library Versions
